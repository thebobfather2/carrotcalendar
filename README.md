## Usage/Examples

With **Carrot** you can easily switch the time zone to check what time an event will take place for your friends in order to better coordinate online meetups. Additionally, when a user adds an event to the Carrot Calendar, the data is stored on the cloud! This allows multiple communities to install the app on their sites too so that events can be more easily coordinated with partnering projects! Setting up a Rumble Royale, a Twitter Space, or Poker Night with friends across the globe has never been easier!
